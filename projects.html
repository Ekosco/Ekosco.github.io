            <h4><b>AMWHO Regional Conference: 2019</b></h4>
            <p>As the President of the University of Oklahoma chapter of the American Mock World Health Organization, I am acting as an Executive Co-director for our very first regional conference. Due to the success of our One-day Summit, our chapter has decided to host a two-day regional summit in which undergraduate, graduate and high school students from the entire midwestern region of the United States are invited to attend. As executive Co-director, I work closely with a summit board group of 8 individuals with incredibly diverse backgrounds on a variety of tasks including outreach to several universities and high schools in the region, the organization and maintenance of funds allocated to us by the University of Oklahoma Student Government Association as well as the OU Hudson College of Public Health, and the recruitment and arrangements of speakers for our conference. </p>
