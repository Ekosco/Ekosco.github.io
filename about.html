                My Elizabeth Kosco and I am a graduating senior majoring in Management Information Systems
                and International Business. Outside of my academic life, I am highly involved on campus, serving
                as the Director of Alumni Relations for the JCPenney Leadership Program, the former President of
                the American Mock World Health Organization, and a consultant for The Oklaoma Group, a student-led non-profit
                consulting group.
